### **2FA Two Factor Authentication Security Checklist**  

**Objective:**  
To identify and test potential vulnerabilities in the 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) process that attackers could exploit.  

### Key Steps 

### **1. Response Manipulation**  
- **Test:**  
  Change the `"success"` value in the response from `"false"` to `"true"` or modify the HTTP status code from `4xx` to `200 OK`.

### **2. 2FA Code Exposure in Response**  
- **Test:**  
  Check server responses for any leaked 2FA codes when initiating the 2FA process.

### **3. JavaScript File Analysis**  
- **Test:**  
  Analyze JavaScript files for exposed information about 2FA mechanisms or tokens.

### **4. Reuse of 2FA Tokens**  
- **Test:**  
  Attempt to use the same 2FA token repeatedly.

### **5. Brute Forcing 2FA Tokens**  
- **Test:**  
  Check if the system lacks rate-limiting protections by trying multiple codes in quick succession.

### **6. **2FA Code Leakage via Error Messages**  
   - Submit partial or incorrect codes and observe if error messages leak any information about the validity of entered digits.  

### **7. CSRF Vulnerability on 2FA Disabling**  
- **Test:**  
  Exploit the absence of CSRF protection to disable or enable 2FA.

### **8. **Enabling 2FA Without Notification**  
   - Test whether an attacker can enable or disable 2FA on the victim's account without notifying the account owner.  

### **9. Backup Code Exploitation**  
- **Test:**  
  Use backup codes from an attacker’s account to bypass the victim's 2FA.

### **10. Token Sharing Between Accounts**  
- **Test:**  
  Validate if a 2FA token from one account can be reused on another account by modifying user parameters.

### **11. Subdomain Weaknesses**  
- **Test:**  
  Access older subdomains or endpoints that may not enforce 2FA or have weaker implementations.

### **12. Clickjacking on 2FA Disabling**  
- **Test:**  
  Attempt clickjacking attacks to trick the victim into disabling 2FA unknowingly.

### **13. Empty or Null Values in 2FA**  
- **Test:**  
  Send empty, null, or generic values (e.g., `000000`) for 2FA codes and analyze the behavior.

### **14. Cookie Tampering on OTP Step**  
- **Test:**  
  During OTP verification, tamper with cookies or remove parameters and observe if the OTP step is bypassed.

### **15. Old API Versions**  
- **Test:**  
  Check older API versions for vulnerabilities in 2FA implementation by reviewing archived files or JavaScript endpoints.

### **16. Skipping Password Validation**  
- **Test:**  
  Test if 2FA bypass can be achieved by providing valid backup codes with an incorrect password.

### **17.  Enabling 2FA without email verification
- **Test:**  
Try enabling 2FA on an account that hasn't verified its email yet. If the email isn't verified, it could prevent the victim from creating an account or bypassing the 2FA step later, 

### **18. Linking Victim’s Account to Attacker’s 2FA**  
- **Test:**  
  Attempt to intercept and modify requests for 2FA setup to link the victim’s account with the attacker’s authenticator.

### **19. Login Through Social Platforms**  
- **Test:**  
  Log in using third-party platforms (e.g., Google) and observe if 2FA enforcement is skipped.

### **20. Reusing Older Tokens or Backup Codes**  
- **Test:**  
  Validate if older OTPs or backup codes remain valid even after new ones are generated.

### **21. Code Expiration Policies**  
- **Test:**  
  Analyze OTP expiration policies to see if codes remain valid for longer than expected.

### **22. Disabling 2FA without User Confirmation**
- **Test:**  
  Check if 2FA can be disabled through an email link sent by the attacker. If the victim does not confirm the 2FA disabling by clicking the link before it expires, 2FA will be automatically disabled, allowing the attacker to gain access.

### **23. Deleting the Account via API Endpoint with Account Password without 2FA Verification**
- **Test:**  
  Check if the account can be deleted using an API endpoint by providing the account password, without requiring 2FA verification. 

### **24. Linking Victim’s ID to Attacker’s Authenticator**  
- **Test:**  
  Modify user IDs in 2FA setup requests to link the victim’s account to the attacker’s authenticator.

### **25. Auto-Disabling 2FA on Login**  
- **Test:**  
  Log in through alternative methods (e.g., third-party logins) and observe if 2FA is disabled automatically.

### **26. Skipping Steps by Tampering Requests**  
- **Test:**  
  During 2FA setup or login, intercept requests, replace user-specif
